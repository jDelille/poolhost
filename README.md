## Poolhost
Make the NFL season more exciting by joining NFL Poolhost. Make weekly picks, compete, and chat with other players. 
You must create a free account to make picks, check the leaderboard, and chat. For the backend, I am using Google Firebase. The frontend is deplyed using Netlify and the backend s deployed using Heroku. This makes it easy to include new updates with little to no hassle!
